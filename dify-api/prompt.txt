Create a single-container Docker setup for Dify API (use the latest official image).
Do not use Docker Compose. Only Docker Build and Docker Run are allowed.
Map the API on port 8080 and expose the port to 5001.
There should be health check route at 5001/health.
The container must treat /temp as the only writable directory (assume everything else may be read-only).
Load environment variables from a local .env file via --env-file.
Provide a Dockerfile and the exact build/run commands.

Use these defaults (overridable by .env):
REDIS_URL=redis://host.docker.internal:6379/0
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://dify:dify@localhost:5432/dify
QDRANT_URL=http://host.docker.internal:6334
PORT=8080

Ensure all temp/cache/uploads/logs paths resolve under /temp (e.g., set TMPDIR=/temp, and any storage/log paths to /temp/...).
Create /temp with correct permissions and avoid root if possible.
Output should include: Dockerfile, sample .env, and docker build/docker run commands.
